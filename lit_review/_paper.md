# Introduction

## Research Topic

In this literature review, we intend to examine the overwhelming attention devoted to cryptocurrencies within the blockchain academic and industrial community; the effects this has on society, the environment, and geopolitical relations with developing countries; and a few examples of successful applications of blockchain technology outside of the financial sector.

## Background

Blockchain technology was popularised by bitcoin, an open-source cryptocurrency whose original author is yet to be identified. In recent times, the rise in popularity and market value of bitcoin has led to an explosion in the number of cryptocurrencies in existence. As a result, most of the efforts in blockchain research have been focused on cryptocurrencies. We propose that this attention amplifies the many adverse effects of cryptocurrencies on society and highlight some other applications of the underlying blockchain technology.

## Importance to Field

We believe this review to be important because it attempts to connect the attention being paid to cryptocurrencies over other applications of the blockchain technology to their effects to society. Usually, the topic of cryptocurrency harm is discussed from a technical perspective---how the underlying algorithms and design choices of the engineers contribute to the problem.

## Review Structure

The review will open with a brief description and history of blockchain. From these, the properties of the technology that make it suitable for a *cryptocurrency* will be highlighted. Next, an overview of cryptocurrencies---along with their advantages and disadvantages---will be provided. Finally, we motivate the idea that society is better served when there's a shift of focus to other areas of application of the blockchain by discussing some examples from these areas.

# Body

## Paragraph 1

- **Claim:** The history of blockchain predates but has become tied to that of bitcoin.
- **Evidence:** [@an_blockchain_2023]
- **Author:** Favour Anefu


## Paragraph 2

- **Claim:** Some of the properties of a blockchain make it suitable as the basis of a cryptocurrency.
- **Evidence:** [@bohme_bitcoin_2015], [@yli-huumo_where_2016]
- **Author:** Favour Anefu


## Paragraph 3

- **Claim:** Cryptocurrencies, using bitcoin as an example, have serious, negative effects on society and the environment.
- **Evidence:** [@foley_sex_2019], [@mora_bitcoin_2018], [@holtmeier_impact_nodate]
- **Author:** Anh Nguyen


## Paragraph 4

- **Claim:** There have been successful non-financial applications of blockchain technology, and a focus on these instead could benefit society more.
- **Evidence:** [@azaria_medrec_2016-1], [@cong_blockchain-based_2024]
- **Author:** Anh Nguyen


# Conclusion

- Give summary of findings
- Discuss next steps
  - Future research could analyse in more detail the examples provided for why they were successful.
  - It could also investigate the motivations for the explosion in popularity of cryptocurrencies at the expense of other applications.
- Discuss gaps in current analysis
  - There have been cryptocurrencies that are tied to social causes. These were not talked about in the review.
- Discuss ways of generalizing findings within the field of blockchain research
