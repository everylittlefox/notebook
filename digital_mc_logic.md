## 7_timing diagrams

> the overall purpose of any diagram is to quickly present information.

- to debug the functionality of implemented circuits (actual physical circuits), **logic analysers** are used.
- always include notes on timing diagrams that explain to the reader what it is that they are looking at.
  - what the reader should take note of.
- important things to consider when making timing diagrams
  - include a title
  - don't express too many ideas at the same time.
  - use annotations to highlight the important points
  - don't include signals which have nothing to do with the main idea of the diagram
- steps in building a timing diagram
  - write out the boolean expressions
  - draw the incomplete timing diagram of just the input signals and their arbitrary waveforms.
  - draw and label vertical lines on the timing diagram, and match them to rows of the truth table.
  - fill in the output waveform to correspond to the output of the truth table for each line.


## 9_standard_functions

- in standard SOP form, each minterm contains only one instance of each of the independent variables.
- while minterms correspond to 1's in the output column of the truth table, maxterms correspond to 0's
