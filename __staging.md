- in FET transistors, why is the substrate usually connected to the ground/source?
- what does it mean to bias an FET for use as an amplifier?

- ideas about quality software
  - intuitive ui
  - few bugs
  - easy to change
    - add features, refactor, and fix bugs
  - portable
    - run the same way on different platforms

- fpga clk period - 20ns
- shield clk period - 50ns
  - keep `s_clk` low for 2 periods and high for one period
