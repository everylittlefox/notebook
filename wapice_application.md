### ideas for what I like about Wapice

- IoT-TICKET has massive impact for everyday lives. I saw a presentation about how crowd flow prediction was useful for business owners but also could be used for the consumers to decide on which public places to vist and when.
- Framery Pods are devices I've had the pleasure of using, as they are installed around our school
- the wealth of experience the company has built over the years is unique and would be a deep and plentiful well to draw from

### cover letter

Dear Recruitment Team,

I was excited to learn about the breadth of companies from diverse sectors whose businesses have been aided immensely by the solutions Wapice offers. Its impact goes even beyond the corporate world. Having been a resident of Tampere for over a year, I was delighted to find out Wapice's technologies drive some of the city's public services that I have come to love. It is the extent of this impact, most of all, that makes Wapice an inspiring place to work.

Coupled with my practical experience, my academic journey has prepared me to be successful in the Wapice Talents' Embedded Systems and Electronics track. My academic record tells a story of diligence and commitment to excellence. In addition, completing the projects highlighted in my resume has equipped me with technical skills necessary to serve as a solid foundation for continuous higher learning and development. For example, in my role as a research assistant with Tampere University's Electromechanics Group, I built a deep learning model that achieved a fivefold decrease in runtime while maintaining acceptable accuracy metrics. This experience not only developed my technical acumen but also taught me to communicate my ideas effectively, collaborate with, and seek guidance from more knowledgeable colleagues.

Further experience designing digital logic for FPGAs and writing low-level code for microcontrollers lays the groundwork for contributing to the innovative project Wapice leads. One such project was its collaboration with Framery to build the Framery One, a successful product that integrates electronics and software seamlessly. I believe the challenges the team faced to meet connectivity and speed requirements while working under a tight schedule offered valuable learning opportunities, and I am eager to learn from their experience.

As a company operating at the intersection of IoT and Artificial Intelligence, Wapice will be the ideal environment for me to kickstart my professional career. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity of discussing my background further and how well it aligns with Wapice's values and the requirements of the role.


Yours sincerely,
Favour Ochoche Anefu.



### why I am perfect for the position

I am currently studying Electronics and Embedded Systems at Tampere University, where I have developed a deep fascination for digital electronics and hardware design. My academic record reflects diligence, and my previous experience building efficient predictive models with a research group at my university taught me valuable technical and non-technical skills. An important part of the Wapice Talents program is development under the mentorship of more experienced colleagues. Based on my time with the research group, I believe that I thrive under such conditions. My admiration for the impact Wapice has had on the community and its work with both electronic and AI systems inspires me to become a zealous Wapice Talent who is committed to continuous development.
