- introduction (slide 3)
  - OptiFast is a custom eyewear company.
  - Users can choose from a wide selection of frames, lenses, nose pads and cases.
  - If they use prescription glasses or have their measurements from previous purchases, they could attach those as well.
  - Upon receiving their order, a pair matching their customization is made, packaged, and delivered.
  - OptiFast is targetting two markets.
    - Young, internet savvy people are their primary market, so it is important that the consumer-facing solutions we develop are responsive, stylish and fun.
    - OptiFast also considers retirees and the older population as a secondary market. For them, being able to place orders by phone is important.
  - The developed system should account for all of these.
  - In addition, different company groups have requirements for the system that are particular to them.
    - **during the course of the presentation, we will show some of these requirements and how they were gathered.**
